- **Run as administrator**: For full functionality
- **Free up space**: Consider which cleanup level you need

### After Running
- **Restart recommended**: Especially after system repairs
- **Check results**: Review any warning messages
- **Regular maintenance**: Run monthly for optimal performance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access Denied" Errors**
- **Solution**: Run as administrator
- **Alternative**: Choose a lower cleanup level

**"Path Not Found" Errors**
- **Cause**: Normal on some Windows configurations
- **Impact**: No negative effects, script continues

**System Repair Takes Too Long**
- **Normal**: DISM and SFC scans can take 15-60 minutes
- **Tip**: Don't interrupt the process

**Script Stops Responding**
- **Wait**: System repairs are intensive operations
- **Monitor**: Check Task Manager for DISM/SFC activity
